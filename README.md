# AI_diabetic_predictionsystem_GOPHISHAJ
THIS IS THE PROJECT NAMED " AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION" WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
It falls under the submission of project assigned by IBM NAAN MUDHALVAN COURSE

**Overview**
This project aims to develop an AI-based diabetes prediction system that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant health data and predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

**Features**
Data Input: Users can input their health data, including factors such as age, BMI, family history, and blood pressure.

Machine Learning Models: The system utilizes advanced machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset to make accurate predictions.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface for seamless interaction, making it accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds.

Accuracy and Reliability: The system prioritizes accurate predictions by continuously improving its models through updates.

**How to Use**
Input Data: Enter your health information through the user-friendly interface.
Prediction: The system will analyze the data and provide a prediction regarding the likelihood of diabetes.
Interpretation: Results will be presented in a clear format, indicating the risk level and potential actions to take.

**How to deploy the code on the web app using google colab:**

I. Go to google colab

II. Import the ‘app.py’ file

III. Import the saved model file ‘trained_model.pkl’

IV. Type the following command

!pip install streamlit -q
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com

! streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
